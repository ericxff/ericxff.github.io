                    <blockquote>“That guy is an introvert…I knew it. He was weird to begin with anyways. What a freak.” — some girl in my class</blockquote>

                    <p>Okay, it wasn’t this bad. But I certainly got some weird looks after class.</p>

                    <p>I remember taking this business course in high school that had a unit on emotional intelligence and soft skills. We did a survey that would “determine” whether we were introverted or extroverted.</p>

                    <p>An introvert is generally a person who keeps to themselves, enjoys time alone, and prefers not interacting with other people.</p>

                    <p>An extrovert is an individual who is outgoing, sociable, and loves to meet new people.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Convention</h2>

                    <p>While doing these test surveys, I know a lot of people are tempted to answer dishonestly, or try to boast themselves in order to get a “better” score. And the results reflected this: about 95% of the class were categorized by the test as extroverts. In reality, I’ve never really seen half of these people demonstrate any extroverted qualities. Most of them wouldn’t even dare to answer the teacher’s questions or participate in class.</p>

                    <p>The other 5%? Oh, that’s me… and that other awkward person across the room. The other 95% glared at us, giggling and whispering “ha…<i>introverts</i>.”</p>

                    <p>There’s certainly nothing wrong with being an introvert. I don’t know why some people think that way. I just think that the rest of society (especially those in a 10th grade business class) has been trying too hard to conform to the typical extroverted personality. Why? Because people think that being an extrovert will make you more successful. Consider this:</p>

                    <blockquote>Teacher: When you’re an extrovert, you’re naturally outgoing. You’ll meet new people and expand your network easily. Then you’ll have a plethora of connections to help you find a good job and live a happy life.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>Me: Sir, what if you’re an introvert?</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>Teacher: Oh, wait. You’re an introvert? Oh, okay. Good luck out there.</blockquote>

                    <p>Again, it wasn’t actually this bad.</p>

                    <p>At the least, this dialogue stands for what a lot of people think the situation is. But, I disagree with people that think introverts are at a disadvantage. I think introverts shouldn’t be pressured to try to be sociable. Trying too hard to be outgoing and friendly just makes you look more awkward than before.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introverts and Social Media</h2>

                    <p>More than ever before, introverts have been coming out of their shell to interact with people thanks to the help of social media. It’s a great way to post thoughts and talk to others, without having to actually see them.</p>

                    <p>Many introverts prefer communicating through social media. That’s why you’ll sometimes see a lot of posts on Facebook from friends that don’t even step out of their cave, because it’s a lot easier for them to be outgoing on the internet than face-to-face.</p>

                    <p>There’s something about online communication that provides comfort to all introverts, and it allows them to share some of the deep thoughts and ideas that they think about when they’re alone. It also acts as a platform to let them keep in touch with their close friends, while avoiding the obnoxious Facebook statuses and tweets. So, if you are an introvert, I would suggest to try being active on Facebook, Twitter, maybe Instagram too. It may unleash the online social butterfly within you, and you just might like it.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introvert Strengths</h2>

                    <p>We’ve heard a lot about successful extroverts. Bill Clinton, Steve Jobs, just to name a few. They’re great salespeople, leaders, motivators, etc. They have great jobs and they make great money. But what about introverts?</p>

                    <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook, Bill Gates, Albert Einstein. All very accomplished individuals. They’re also introverts. Not very surprising, is it? What else are they going to do with all of their time spent alone? Certainly not twiddling their thumbs.</p>

                    <p>Introverts are very strong thinkers, innovators, and content creators.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>They always think before they do. Every action, be it a business decision or a clothing purchase, is well-thought-out and researched. Introverts use their online and offline resources to gather all the information they can before arriving to a final decision.</li>

                        <li>They are natural innovators. They can make ideas come out of nowhere. As long as they have time and space away from others, their brainstorming capability is incredible. In the near future, companies are looking to hire people that can bring more ideas to the table — playing to the strengths of introverts.</li>

                        <li>They’re creative. They’re writers, artists, designers, and producers. Today, more than ever, people value the content they consume. That’s the YouTube videos you watch, the books you read, and the blog article you’re looking through right now. With the help of digital media, introverts can take advantage of their inner creativity, and thrive.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>But above all, they’re <b>listeners</b>. They know how to listen, study, and act when appropriate. This skill set is perfect for the digital age, for things like online marketing and social media management. Studying online behaviour can lead to valuable interaction and feedback with potential customers.</p>

                    <p>So, while the extroverts are out at parties and social gatherings, introverts do just fine on their own at home. But they don’t just read novels and watch too much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tntOCGkgt98">YouTube</a>. Inside each of them lies a creator — an artist, an innovator, a virtuoso, a genius. And it’s time for them to see that too.</p>
