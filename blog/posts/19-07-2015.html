                    <p>Yesterday I organized an orientation for all of the newly hired executive members of the Impact Tomorrow team.</p>

                    <p>When I co-founded Impact Tomorrow, it was strictly for competition purposes, and I never thought it would turn out to be anything like this. For the past 2 years we’d been operating with a grassroots approach, hoping that people would support us for our vision and our drive to do good things for the community.</p>

                    <p>At the time, I didn’t register my organization as a nonprofit, so I couldn’t open a bank account under the name “Impact Tomorrow”. I couldn’t apply for grants from big banks and institutes, and I had to awkwardly ask all of my event sponsors to make their donation out to my name or one of my partnering organizations.</p>

                    <p>But finally, just last week, I registered my organization as an official nonprofit. It opens up endless opportunities for my new execs, including the aforementioned grants, or enrolling in exclusive programs like Google Apps for Nonprofits. But aside from the material aspects, establishing NPO status really made me feel like something I created was finally growing. It’s like watching your baby take their first steps, or seeing a seed you planted come into bloom.</p>

                    <p>And I’m so glad we made the move to get nonprofit status, because it makes things so much easier for the new execs next year. Now, rather than worrying about funding, they can focus on growing and scaling the organization to its full potential. This year, we hired execs from all over the Greater Toronto Area. Our 5 new members are spread out across three district school boards, and four different cities. With the right amount of outreach, our events could be huge.</p>

                    <hr class="small">

                    <p>But enough about me being excited. I think it’s important to iterate some important points about managing early-stage nonprofits:</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">1. Co-founders should be mentors</h2>

                    <p>A lot of youth organizations in my community operate like this:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            An executive team is elected to run the organization for one year
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This team holds elections for a new exec. team for the next year
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The former team detaches themselves from the organization, and their involvement is jotted down right onto their resumés
                        </li>   
                    </ol>

                    <p>Sure, this may work for well-established organizations. But, Impact Tomorrow is still in early stages of development. Although we, the co-founders, will be busy at university next year, we still plan to mentor our new execs, provide them with resources, and guide them along the way if they ever get lost. We want to support them, and provide them with inspiration to make sure they don’t feel unmotivated.</p>

                    <p>It shouldn’t stop there, either. This year’s team should help guide and mentor future teams as well, making sure our vision stays intact. This is especially important for early-stage nonprofits; it ensures that the organization can keep growing and scaling.</p>

                    <p>Ultimately, all organizations should be providing this kind of support for incoming executive teams year after year. A smooth transition equates to a smooth work experience.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">2. Fostering Collaboration</h2>

                    <p>A big part of our hiring this year was to ensure that no individual felt as though they were above others. There was no role called “President” or “Executive Director”. Rather, we had 3 roles which were interdependent. No individual could organize the events single-handedly. This meant that our team had to collaborate if they wanted to make our events happen.</p>

                    <p>It eliminates the mindset of:</p>

                    <blockquote>they’re more important to the organization, they should be doing more work
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>and replaces it with:</p>

                    <blockquote>I have to finish my share of work. Other people are depending on me for it.</blockquote>

                    <p>This mentality promotes a collaborative environment that creates value for every person in the organization. Creating value for team members makes everyone happy, and boosts productivity.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">3. Team Bonding</h2>
                    
                    <p>I’ve heard of countless startups that fail because their co-founders just do not get along. In early stages, this is especially important because companies that have a hostile environment end up being a lot less productive, and the same goes for nonprofits.</p>

                    <p>My co-founders and I were good friends before we started Impact Tomorrow, and this helped us work more effectively. We had more frequent meetings because they were fun, and we were excited to work together. But once we start hiring new people, we should make sure that they are also getting along with each other, in order to maximize productivity.</p>

                    <p>In 2014, we hired a graphic designer and a project manager that were good friends of ours, had the skills to get the job done. I found that hand-picking new execs was a lot better than having an application process, because we already knew these people and their work habits, and it was easy for them to adapt to our culture. (Also, I felt like I could convince my friends to do work all the time, rather than bothering some guy who would end up hating me).</p>

                    <p>That said, although we did have an application for execs this year, we felt like it was a step in the right direction in terms of growth. Making the transition as smooth as possible was our top priority, so we put together an orientation day.</p>

                    <h3>But above all…</h3>
                    
                    <p>I just want our new execs to feel like they’re part of the family, and work together well. You’re all extremely talented individuals, and you’ll accomplish great things! Welcome to Impact Tomorrow.</p>
